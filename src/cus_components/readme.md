# Selections

This directory stores the encapsulated general selection UI components. For example, the `Segmented` component used to
select the record info type (balance / usage).

The reason we encapsulated these UI components is that **they may be used more than one time**. For example, the Info
Type Selection will be used both in Diagram Info Showing page and Default Settings Page.
